I am currently a Post Doctorate Research Associate at Purdue University, working with [Dr. Xiao Wang](http://https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~wangxiao/) and [Dr. Haibo Liu](https://sites.google.com/view/haiboliu). 

I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from Purdue University, where I was advised by [Dr. Xiao Wang](http://https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~wangxiao/). 
My research interests lie at the intersection of statistics, machine learning, and generative AI, with a focus on bridging the gap between statistical methodology and modern machine learning techniques. Prior to my Ph.D., I received an M.S. in Statistics from Seoul National University in South Korea, and a B.S. in Mathematical Sciences and Statistics from the same institution. 

Outside of research, I enjoy hiking, weightlifting, CrossFit, and swimming. I also appreciate exploring different coffees, wines, and craft beers.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
